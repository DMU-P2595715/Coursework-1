          <p class="cast"><b>Matthew McConaughey</b> plays <i>Michael Pearson</i> in the Gentlemen, the character of which the whole narrative is based upon. Matthew (born November 4, 1969) is an american actor and producer. he was initialy noticed for his supporting role in the coming-of-age comedy <i> Dazed and Confused</i>, this performance is considered by many to be his breakout role. Mathew made his first big screen appearance on August 6, 1993 in the film <i> My boyfriend's Back</i>, however he was known as "Guy 2". This quickly changed whe he played Wooderson in the film <i>Dazed and Confused</i> alongside many other actors who would later become stars, such as Ben Affleck, Adam Goldberg, Milla Jovovich and many more. He was not originally cast in the film as his role was originally small and meant to be for local talent due to budget purposes, however at the time of casting he was a film student at the University of Texas and had decided one night to go to the Hyatt hotel bar with his girlfriend. This is where he approached the casting director Don Philips and managed to get himslef the role of Wooderson. McConaughey's role was made bigger due to the unsavoury behavour of the actor who played the character Pickford, this meant that Pickford's screen time was cut short in favour of Mathew's character. This allowed Mathew to prove his worth because many of his lines were imporvised and written on the spot.
          <br>
          <br>
          Mathew recieved many positive reviews and was quickly cast in other films; in 1994 McConaughey acted in <i>Angels in the Outfield, Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation</i> and <i>Daniel Johnston' music video ''Life in Vain''</i>. in the early 2000s Mathew was cast in many romantic comedies such as <i>The Wedding Planner</i> and <i>How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days</i>, and these films went on to perform very successfully at the box office. Mathew would also make himself known by promoting his films in interesting ways, bringing more attention to him as an actor and the the films he was promoting. One such film he promoted was the 2005 feature film <i>Sahara</i>, he promoted this by sailing down the Amazon River and trekking to Mali. That same year Mathew was named People Magazine's "Sexiest Man Alive". This line of work had created a very reconized lifestyle that McConaughey wanted to deviate from, he had realised that living on the beach, running with his shirt off and doing romantic comedies had caused him to be the typecast for certain roles with the romantic genre of which he had already become an established actor for. This caused him to seek other other dramatic work within different genres; this shift in his choice of acting roles has been known as the "<i>McConaissance</i>" between 2011 and 2014.
        <br>
        <br>
        This shift into other dramatic works would broaden McConaughey's acting ability and give him the ability to show other casting directors that he had the skills to perform in near enough any genre. This led to him being cast in works such as 2012s <i>Magic Mike</i> where Mathew starred alongside Channing Tatum, another incredibly well-known actor who had branched out from the romantic genre.</p>

             <b>Hugh John Mungo Grant</b> <i>plays Fletcher</i> in the Gentlemen. Grant (born 9 September 1960) is an english actor who has accumilated a number of awards throughout his career such as a Golden Globe Award, a BAFTA Award and an Honorary Ce&#769;sar. Hugh began his acting career at Oxford University where he made his debut in the Oxford-financed film <i>Privileged</i>, Hugh studied English and graduated with a 2:1 honours but had always viewed acting as nothing more than a creative outlet. After his debut Hugh dabbled in a variety of jobs, such as working as an assistant groundsman at Fulham Footbal Club, tutoring, writing comedy sketches for TV shows and working for Talkback Productions to write and produce radio commercials for products. At a screening of <i>Priveleged</i> at BAFTA in London, he was approached by a talent agent who offered to represent him. He first declined in order to begin his Master of Pilosophy degree, but later reconsidered, thinking that acting for a year would be a good was to save some money for his studies.

         <br>
         Soon afterwards he was offered a supporting role in <i>The Bounty</i>, however he was prevented from acting because he didn't have an Equity card, this was only earned through acting in regional theatre. In order to obtain this Hugh joined the Nottingham Playhouse where he was given small roles in which to play. he soon became bored of these roles and created his own sketch-comedy group called The Jockeys of Norfolk with which he toured around London's pub comedy circuit. he gained a lot of attraction through this and he was offered a spot on Russell Harty's BBC2 TV show <i>Harty Goes to...</i>.
         <br>
         <br>
         Grant started his professional career in a number of small roles, gradually making a name for himself however at age 34 Grant claimed to have been on the brink of giving up but was surprised by the script of <i>Four Weddings and a Funeral</i>. "If you read as many bad scripts as I did, you'd know how grateful you are when you come across one where the guy is actually funny," he stated. Released in 1994 with Grant as the protaganist , <i>Four Weddings and a Funeral</i> became the highest-grossing british film to date with a box office in excess of 244 million dollars, which made him an overnight international star. From here his career exploded and over the coming decades he would star in award winning films and act alongside other famous celebrities.
